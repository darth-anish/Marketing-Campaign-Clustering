# Marketing-Campaign-Clustering

This project is a part of portfolio exam for the course Mathematics and Multivariate Data Statistics (Master's in Data Science, S2023) in Kiel University of Applied Sciences, Kiel, Germany.

This project consists of a artificial story of why we are doing it and how it can create a value for a retail store. From the technical point of view, it has Exploratory Data Analysis, Feature Engineering, Comparison of different clustering algorithms. This project also has a great analysis of clusters from business point of view.

For the clustering, I have used KMeans and Optics DBSCAN algorithms with and without PCA on the dataset. Sihouette coefficient score plot and Reachability plot are used for hyperparameters tuning KMeans and Optics models. This dataset has no a distinctive boundary between clusters making it a bit challenging to do clustering. However, with feature engineering on continuous features, a reasonable clusters are found and analyzed.
